            <h1>Program your own synthesiser modules</h1>
            <p>We are proud to present Patchblocks, a modular synthesiser and signal
               processing system where you decide what the hardware does. You want a
               filter module? Turn your Patchblock into one! You want a crazy sounding
               bassline synth with built-in arppegiator? Make it so! We provide you
               with an empty canvas, your imagination fills it.</p>

            <h1>How does it work?</h1>
            <p>All you need is a Patchblock, a Mac or Windows PC and our free software.
                The software allows you to program your hardware module the way you want.
                This is done in a so called “visual programming language”, in other words,
                you don't have to go into 100% geek mode and write code to make it happen.
                Visual programming is easy, you choose from a variety of low level sound
                processing elements and combine their functions by connecting them with
                virtual cables – a bit like a modular synthesiser, but in software. Your
                library of software modules includes signal generators and processors
                (e.g. oscillators, filters, delays etc.), signal routing options and even
                modules for algorithmic composition. Our editor lets you emulate how your
                patch will sound and once you’re happy with it you can upload it to your
                Patchblock hardware simply by connecting it via USB. Once programmed you
                can unplug the Patchblock and jam away. </p>

            <h1>What can I do with them?</h1>
            <p>A lot, it's really up to you. Plug some of your other gear in and use them
                as a sound processor if you want. Make an awesome noise box that produces
                pure digital filth. Let them play a concerto of chaos based algorithmic
                sequences. But also don't forget to think outside the box! Because you can
                combine several Patchblocks, you can make them work together. One Patchblock
                could for example generate an LFO (Low Frequency Oscillator) that you plug
                into another block to modulate processes that happen in there. Or you can
                create a chain of audio effects and processes. You can do this analogue style,
                by connecting them with audio cables, or via a digital connection, by clicking
                the Patchblocks together directly. Or even both!</p>
